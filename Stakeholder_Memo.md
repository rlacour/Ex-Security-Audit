SUBJECT: Internal IT Audit Findings and Recommendations


Dear Colleagues,

Please review the following information regarding the Botium Toys internal audit scope, goals, critical findings, summary and recommendations.

### Scope: 
The scope of this audit encompasses the entire security program at Botium Toys. All security measures must be assessed against the value of assets alongside internal processes and procedures for accounting, endpoint protection, firewalls, intrusion detection system, SIEM tool. This requires assessing current security controls, hardware and system access points, and user permissions to align with PCI DSS and GDPR compliance requirements.

### Goals: 
The audit’s goal is to identify controls Botium Toys can adopt to adhere to the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF) and establish a set of policies and procedures, including playbooks to implement and maintain the following: general fortification of systems, the improvement of systems to ensure compliance, and implement the concept of least permissions for user credential management, and ensure compliance requirements are met.

### Critical findings (must be addressed immediately): 

Currently there is inadequate management of assets and threats to business continuity are generally unmitigated as Botium Toys is not in compliance with US and international regulations and standards related to privacy and credit card transactions in addition to not having a plan to handle security breaches and losses of data. Recommendations include becoming compliant with PCI DSS & GDPR guidelines and creating new policies for identity and access management to control who has access to what assets. Specific controls to address these gaps include:

|Security Control Type|
|:------|
|Control of Least Privilege and Separation of Duties|
|Disaster recovery plans|
|Password, access control, and account management policies, including the implementation of a password management system|
|Encryption (for secure website transactions)|
|Intrusion Detection System (IDS)|
|Backups|
|Malware software|
|CCTV|
|Locks|
|Manual monitoring, maintenance, and intervention for legacy systems|
|Fire detection and prevention systems|
|SOC type 1 and 2 assessments|


### Findings (should be addressed, but no immediate need):  
Additional controls should be implemented when possible.

|Security Control Type|
|:------|
|Improved lighting
|Locking cabinets
|Signage indicating alarm service provider

### Summary/Recommendations: 
It is recommended that Botium Toys take immediate steps to come into compliance with PCI and GDPR requirements. It otherwise could see serious repercussions in reputation and financial penalties if customers’ online payment information is compromised and does not respond appropriately. To additionally protect customer privacy and ensure business continuity, Botium Toys should implement the concept of lease permissions in access management. SOC1 and SOC2 guidance related to user access policies and overall data safety should be used to develop appropriate policies and procedures. Next, Botium Toys must create disaster recovery plans that include SIEM, IDS, and Malware software to detect possible security breaches and mitigate risks. It should also develop playbooks to follow when responding to breaches in security. Finally, controls should be implemented to secure Botium Toys’ physical location by utilizing basic precautions such as CCTV recording, durable locks, improved lighting, and security alarm signage to create an externally strong security posture. Additional controls can be added as is convenient such as locking cabinets, a time-controlled safe, and fire detection and prevention systems. These comprehensive interventions will significantly improve Botium Toys’ operations and overall security.
