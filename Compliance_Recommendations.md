## Compliance Recommendations regarding customer data
Botium Toys must become compliant with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) because it holds sensitive personally identifiable information and financial information included in transactions from the United States and the European Union. Because Botium Toys handles this type of information, SOC type 1 and 2 should be considered to identify appropriate user access to mitigate risk and ensure data security.
